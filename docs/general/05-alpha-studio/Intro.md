## Key Features

1. **Modular Configuration**:
   - Alpha Studio provides a suite of configuration panels for full control over agent behavior:
     - **Character Configuration**: Define tone, style, and output preferences for your agents.
     - **Data Configuration**: Select datasets, define sliding windows or fixed ranges, and write test queries.
     - **LLM Configuration**: Set up LLM providers, models, and API keys for your favorite model.

2. **Live Testing and Logs**:
   - Run agents directly in the IDE and view real-time execution logs to debug and refine their behavior.
   - Monitor key stages like data fetching, processing, and output generation.

3. **Real-Time Output Previews**:
   - Instantly see how your agent interprets and analyzes data.
4. **Templates for Rapid Development**:
   - Start with pre-built agent templates like "Cat Cafe" or create agents from scratch.
   - Templates provide a quick way to see what's possibles.

5. **Seamless Deployment**:
   - Deploy your agent with a single click after testing and configuration.
   - Once deployed, agents operate on live blockchain data, delivering continuous insights.

#### **How Alpha Studio Works**

1. **Set Up Your Agent**:
   - Use templates or configure a new agent by defining its data inputs, model preferences, and behavior.

2. **Test Your Configuration**:
   - Run test queries to validate datasets and preview outputs.
   - Adjust sliding windows, fixed ranges, or queries as needed to fine-tune performance.

3. **Deploy and Operate**:
   - Deploy your agent to a live environment, where it processes real-time blockchain data.
   - Use execution logs and feedback to monitor and optimize the agentâ€™s performance.
