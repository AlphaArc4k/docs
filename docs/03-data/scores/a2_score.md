# Alpha-2 (A2) Score: Dynamic Risk-Adjusted Ranking

:::note
The A2 score is currently being developed and tested.
:::

Building on the foundation of the A1 Score, the A2 Score introduces dynamic risk adjustment by factoring in wallet behavior patterns, specifically focusing on past involvement in rug pulls and market manipulation schemes. While the A1 Score measures authentic market activity, the A2 Score refines this by weighting participants based on their trustworthiness, ensuring a more nuanced and dynamic risk analysis.

#### **How the A2 Score Works**

1. **Incorporates A1 Metrics**:
   - Retains the foundational elements of the A1 Score, such as authentic activity and market state alignment.

2. **Dynamic Weight Adjustments**:
   - Wallets with histories of involvement in rug pulls or suspicious schemes are assigned lower weights.
   - Trustworthy wallets (e.g., long-term holders, consistent traders) retain or gain higher influence in the score calculation.

3. **Behavioral Analysis**:
   - Analyzes transaction patterns, token interactions, and wallet age to identify red flags.
   - Adjusts scores dynamically to reflect real-time shifts in wallet activity and trustworthiness.

#### **Use Cases**

- **Rug Pull Detection**:  
   - Highlights tokens with high activity from wallets frequently associated with schemes.
- **Risk Mitigation**:  
   - Filters out risky tokens or wallets from agent recommendations, focusing on safer market opportunities.
- **Agent Insights**:  
   - Enables agents to factor in both market interest (A1) and risk (A2) for more balanced outputs.

#### **Conclusion**

The A2 Score refines the A1 Score by adding a layer of risk assessment, dynamically adjusting for wallet credibility. 
By integrating this into the agent workflow, AlphaArc ensures that insights prioritize both market relevance and safety, helping users make informed, risk-aware decisions.
